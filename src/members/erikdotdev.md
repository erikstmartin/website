I've been a professional software engineer, web developer, systems architect, and developer advocate for over 15 years.

I currently work as a Principal Cloud Advocate at Microsoft. I specialize in Linux, Distributed Systems, Containers, Kubernetes, and Information Security. I'm also actively involved in Open Source, co-authored the Go in Action book, and co-organize GopherCon, the annual Go programming language conference.
